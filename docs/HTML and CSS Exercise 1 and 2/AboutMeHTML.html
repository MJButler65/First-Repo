        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Guangzhou, China and was adopted by my parents in June of 2004.</p>
        <p>Ever since then I've had a pretty normal life consisting of me going to school, playing sports, going to family functions, etc.</p>
        <p>I went to high school at South Fayette where I was in the marching band and then eventually I was accepted to Pitt Greensburg and now were all cought up</p>

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>When I'm not at school I'm at home with my mom, dad, little sister, and dog.</p>
        <p>My dad works at Pitt Main and my mom works at home doing PR for her many clients. My sister is a seniro in high school and plans to go to Pitt Main and study pharmacy</p>
        <p>My dog, Minnie, is going to be 10 years old. She is a little yorkie i got in middle school and have loved dearly since.</p>

        <h4>My Life Now</h4>
        <p>Right now I am a 3rd year in college with a Data Analytics major and CS minor. </p>
        <p> Ever since becoming a student here, I haave made a few very close friends along with finding my current girlfriend. All of these people make a better person and I could not be happier</p>
        <p>I'm not sure what my plans are after I graduate but know that I am taking it one step at a time and enjoying life and taking things one step at a time.</p>
        <p>I just got offered a spot for an internship for Disney's LucasFilm over the summer in San Fransisco, so that's what my life is looking like now.</p>
